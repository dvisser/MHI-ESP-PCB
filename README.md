# MHI-ESP-PCB
ESP8266 based WiFi module for MHI split-system air conditioners that communicates directly with the air conditioner via the indoor unit PCB "CNS" (spi data) and "CNE" (display board data) connectors.

This module is designed to run firmware developed jointly with TZB (thezerobeast) which is available here https://github.com/TheZeroBeast/ACWiFi

This PCB was designed and developed using KiCAD :-)
