# MHI-ESP-PCB
ESP8266 based WiFi module for MHI split-system air conditioners that communicates directly with the air conditioner via the indoor unit PCB "CNS" (spi data) and "CNE" (infra-red data) connectors.

This module is designed to run firmware developed jointly with TZB (thezerobeast) which is available here https://github.com/TheZeroBeast/ACWiFi

This PCB was designed and developed using KiCAD :-)
